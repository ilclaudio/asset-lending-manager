# CODING_STANDARDS.md


## Purpose

Coding rules for this project.
Write code according to official WordPress standards and project-specific conventions.


## Quality Priorities

- Correctness and robustness.
- Security first (sanitize input, escape output, capability checks, nonces).
- Accessibility (WCAG-oriented decisions).
- Readability and maintainability.
- Compliance with WordPress Coding Standards.


## Core PHP/WordPress Rules

### Formatting and documentation

- Use tabs for indentation.
- New comments and docblocks must be in English.
- Legacy comments/docblocks in other languages can remain temporarily; when touching nearby code, prefer incremental migration to English.
- Add a file header docblock.
- Add function docblocks with params/return.

### Naming conventions

- Classes: `Class_Name_With_Underscores`
- Functions: `function_name_with_underscores`
- Variables: `$variable_name_with_underscores`
- Constants: `CONSTANT_NAME_UPPERCASE`
- Files: `file-name-with-hyphens.php`

### Code structure

- Prefer small, focused functions.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting.
- Keep nesting shallow.
- Extract complex conditions into clearly named variables.
- Align consecutive assignments when it improves readability.

### Security

- Sanitize all external input (`sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `esc_url_raw`, etc.).
- Escape all output by context (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`, `esc_url`, `wp_kses_post`).
- Use nonces for state-changing actions.
- Check capabilities (`current_user_can`) before privileged operations.

### WordPress-specific implementation

- Prefer WordPress APIs over raw PHP alternatives.
- Prefix custom functions/classes (project prefix: `alm_`).
- Use `$wpdb->prepare()` for dynamic SQL.
- Enqueue scripts/styles with WordPress enqueue APIs.


## Frontend Standards (HTML, CSS, JS)

Official references:
- HTML: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/html/
- CSS: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/css/
- JavaScript: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/javascript/

### HTML

- Prefer Bootstrap Italia components/patterns before custom structures.
- Keep semantic, valid, well-formed HTML.
- Use lowercase tags/attributes and quote all attribute values.
- Keep mixed PHP/HTML indentation coherent.

### CSS

- Prefer Bootstrap Italia components, patterns, and utility classes before custom CSS.
- Use tabs for indentation.
- One selector/property per line; keep declarations explicit and readable.
- Follow WordPress CSS formatting conventions.
- Prefer shorthand and consistent value style (`0` without units where valid, unitless `line-height` where appropriate).

### JavaScript

- For new features/refactors, prefer Vanilla JavaScript.
- Existing jQuery-based areas are considered legacy and can be maintained when editing those files.
- Do not introduce new jQuery usage in new modules unless explicitly approved by the user.
- Use tabs, semicolons, and braces consistently.
- Prefer `const`/`let` over `var`.
- Use single quotes and descriptive camelCase names.
- Keep lines readable.


## Internationalization (i18n)

- All user-facing strings must be translatable.
- Use the proper escaping i18n helpers (`esc_html__`, `esc_html_e`, etc.).
- Use translator comments for formatted strings.


## Testing and Checks

- Write testable code (small units, clear dependencies).
- Add tests for non-trivial logic when practical.
- Run:
  - `composer run lint:php`
  - `composer run lint:php:fix` (when needed)
