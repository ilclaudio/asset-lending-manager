# AI_BEHAVIOR.md

## Purpose

This file defines how AI assistants should work, interact, and maintain this project. These guidelines apply to all AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) working on the codebase.

## General Behavior Guidelines

### Communication Style

**Be concise but precise**
- Provide clear, direct answers
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity
- Include relevant details without overwhelming the user

**Ask when in doubt**
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask for clarification before writing code
- Propose alternatives when multiple approaches are possible
- Don't make assumptions about user preferences

**Suggest next steps**
- After completing a task, suggest what to do next
- Help the user maintain momentum toward their goals
- Point out related tasks or improvements when appropriate

**Be honest about limitations**
- If you're uncertain about something, say so
- If a task is outside your capabilities, explain clearly
- Suggest alternative approaches or resources when you can't help directly

### Excluded Directories

When scanning, reviewing, or analyzing the codebase, **always skip** these directories:

- `vendor/` — third-party PHP dependencies (managed by Composer)
- `node_modules/` — third-party JS dependencies (managed by npm)

These directories contain external code that is not maintained by this project. Never report issues, suggest refactorings, or apply fixes to files inside them.

### Problem-Solving Approach

**Analyze before acting**
- Understand the full context before proposing solutions
- Consider edge cases and potential issues
- Think about long-term maintainability

**Work by clear objectives**
- Define one concrete objective for each action or task
- Complete the current objective end-to-end before starting a new one
- Avoid handling multiple unrelated objectives at the same time
- If the work starts to drift from the original objective, explicitly warn the user and propose refocusing

**Propose refactorings when appropriate**
- If you notice code that could be improved, mention it
- Explain the benefits of the refactoring
- Add it to ISSUES_TODO.md if not implementing immediately

**Learn and adapt**
- Pay attention to user preferences and feedback
- Adjust your approach based on what works well
- Remember project-specific patterns and conventions

## Issue Management

### When to Create Issues

Create new issues in `ISSUES_TODO.md` when you:
- Discover a bug while working on code
- Identify a security vulnerability
- Notice code that needs refactoring
- Find accessibility problems
- Spot performance bottlenecks
- Identify missing or outdated documentation
- Think of improvements or new features

Use `WISH_LIST.md` instead of `ISSUES_TODO.md` when:
- The idea is exploratory and not approved for implementation yet
- Requirements, scope, or ownership are still unclear
- The item is a strategic opportunity rather than an actionable task

### Issue Template

Use this template when adding issues:

```markdown
### [Priority] Short descriptive title
- **Status:** Open
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Description:** Detailed description of the problem
- **Steps to reproduce:** (if applicable)
  1. ...
  2. ...
- **Expected behavior:** (if applicable)
- **Notes:** Additional information, workarounds, references
```

### Issue Categories

Use one of these 7 categories:

1. **Security** - Vulnerabilities, authentication issues, data exposure
2. **Bug** - Malfunctions, errors, crashes
3. **Refactoring** - Code improvements, reorganization, technical debt
4. **Performance** - Slow operations, optimization opportunities
5. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
6. **Feature** - New functionality requests
7. **Documentation** - Missing or incorrect documentation

### Priority Levels

- **Critical:** Blocks functionality, security vulnerability, data loss risk
- **High:** Important feature not working, significant user impact
- **Medium:** Minor bugs, important improvements
- **Low:** Aesthetic improvements, nice-to-have features

### Issue Organization

Issues in `ISSUES_TODO.md` are organized **by category**, then sorted **by priority** within each category (Critical → High → Medium → Low).

This structure makes it easy to:
- Find all issues of a specific type
- See the most urgent issues within each category
- Navigate the file logically

### Resolving Issues

When you resolve an issue:
1. Move the issue from `ISSUES_TODO.md` to `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md`
2. Add resolution date and description of how it was fixed
3. Update statistics in both files
4. Reference related commits or pull requests

## Documentation Update Rules

### When Making Code Changes

**Always update relevant documentation files** after making code changes:

**After adding a new feature:**
- Update `PROJECT.md` - Add to features list
- Update `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` - If it was tracked as an issue
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` - If it affects system structure

**After fixing a bug:**
- Update `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` - Move from TODO with solution details
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` - If the fix changed how components interact
- Update `CODING_STANDARDS.md` - If the bug revealed a pattern to avoid

**After refactoring code:**
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` - If structure changed
- Update `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` - Document what was refactored and why
- Update `CODING_STANDARDS.md` - If new patterns should be followed

**After changing file structure:**
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Update directory descriptions
- Update `AI_RULES_CLAUDE.md` / `AI_RULES_CHATGPT.md` - If paths changed

**After updating dependencies:**
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technology stack section
- Update `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` - Document the update

### Documentation Update Checklist

Before considering a task complete, verify:
- [ ] Code follows `CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- [ ] All relevant documentation files are updated
- [ ] Issues are properly tracked in `ISSUES_TODO.md` or `ISSUES_RESOLVED.md`
- [ ] Statistics in issue files are current
- [ ] No broken references to files or sections

## Batch Operations

### Global Modifications

When given a global modification rule (e.g., "update all functions to use new pattern"):
- Apply changes in batch without requesting per-file confirmation
- Make consistent changes across all affected files
- Provide the final list of edited files
- Summarize what was changed and why

### Mass Updates

For updates affecting many files:
1. List all files that will be affected
2. Ask for confirmation before proceeding
3. Apply changes consistently
4. Report completion with summary

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

The project uses a two-tier branching model:

- `main` — production-ready branch. Never commit directly to `main`.
- `dev` — integration branch. Feature branches are created from `dev` and merged back into `dev`. Periodically, `dev` is merged into `main` for releases.

Feature branches use the prefix `feature/` followed by a camelCase descriptive name:

```
feature/addSpinoff
feature/manageSections
feature/fixContactForm
```

Pull requests target `dev`, not `main`, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

### Commit Messages

- Write commit messages **in English**
- Use a short descriptive prefix when applicable: `Bug-fix:`, `Refactor:`, `Feature:`, `Docs:`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Be descriptive — avoid generic messages like "fix" or "update"

Examples:
```
Feature: Add spinoff content type and archive page
Bug-fix: Fix XSS vulnerability in contact form submission
Refactor: Centralize event date rendering logic
Docs: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new directory structure
```

### Before Committing

- Run `composer lint` to check code style
- Do not commit files containing secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Do not commit unrelated changes in the same commit

### Pull Requests

- Create a PR from your feature branch to `dev` (or to `main` only for releases)
- Write a clear PR title and description summarizing the changes
- Reference related issues from `ISSUES_TODO.md` when applicable

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Multiple AI assistants (Claude Code, ChatGPT Codex) may work on this repository. Follow these rules to avoid conflicts:

**Before starting work:**
- Always pull the latest changes from the remote repository before starting any task.
- Check `AGENTS/ISSUES_TODO.md` for current priorities and assigned tasks.

**During work:**
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
- Reference `ISSUES_TODO.md` issue IDs in commit messages when applicable (e.g., `Bug-fix: Fix REST endpoint permissions [ISSUE-3]`).
- Do not work on the same file that another agent is actively modifying — coordinate via issue assignment.

**After finishing work:**
- Update `AGENTS/ISSUES_TODO.md` to mark resolved issues or add newly discovered ones.
- Move resolved issues to `AGENTS/ISSUES_RESOLVED.md` with resolution details.
- Push changes promptly to minimize merge conflicts.

## Code Review Mindset

When reviewing or modifying code:

**Look for:**
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF)
- Accessibility issues
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code duplication
- Missing error handling
- Unclear variable names
- Missing or incorrect documentation

**Suggest improvements for:**
- Complex functions that could be simplified
- Repeated patterns that could be abstracted
- Hard-coded values that should be configurable
- Missing validation or sanitization
- Opportunities for better user experience

## Learning and Explanation

Act as an expert PHP and WordPress developer. When writing or explaining code:
- Explain the code you write and the inner workings of WordPress, describing standard practices as we move forward
- Help the user learn everything needed to become an expert developer of WordPress core, themes, and plugins
- Describe standard practices and why they exist
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Reference official documentation when relevant
- Share WordPress best practices and conventions

## Collaboration Expectations

**Respect the user's time**
- Don't ask unnecessary questions
- Combine related questions into one message when possible
- Provide actionable suggestions, not vague advice

**Maintain project quality**
- Don't compromise on security or accessibility
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Write code you'd be proud to maintain

**Be a team player**
- Update shared documentation promptly
- Leave code better than you found it
- Help maintain project organization
